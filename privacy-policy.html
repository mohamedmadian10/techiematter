        </h5>
        <p>
            We will only use Data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need
            to
            use it
            for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an
            explanation as
            to how
            the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contacts us on the e-mail
            address
            <a href="mailto:info@techiematter.com">info@techiematter.com</a>
            If we need to use Data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will
            explain
            the legal
            basis which allows us to do so. Please note that we may process Data without your knowledge or consent, in
            compliance
            with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law

            Data of Children

        </h3>

        <p>
            Our Services are not intended for children, which we consider to be: (i) individuals that are 16 years of
            age or
            below,
            or the age of privacy consent in your jurisdiction; or (ii) when processing Data on the basis of a contract,
            the
            age of
            legal capacity to enter into the agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will only collect or process Data belonging to children under very limited circumstances. We might need
            to
            collect
            personal information belonging to children as part of our Service. We will only collect personal information
            belonging
            to children if it is provided by and with consent of a parent or guardian. If we become aware that we have
            processed the
            personal information of a child without the valid consent of a parent or guardian, we will delete the
            personal
            information.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Data security
        </h3>
        <p>

            We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent Data from being accidentally lost, used or
            accessed in an
            unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to Data to those employees,
            contractors,
            third
            party service providers and other parties who have a valid need to know. They will only process Data in
            accordance with
            our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected Data breach and will notify you and any
            applicable
            regulator
            of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Data retention
        </h3>

        <h5>
            How long will we use Data?
        </h5>
        <p>
            We will only retain Data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for,
            including for
            the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory or reporting requirements. We may retain Data for a longer
            period in
            the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our
            relationship
            with you.
        </p>
        <p>
            To determine the appropriate retention period for Data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of
            the
            Data, the
            potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of Data, the purposes for which we process Data
            and
            whether
            we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, or other
            requirements
        </p>
        <p>
            When it is no longer necessary to retain Data, we will delete it
        </p>
        <h3>
            What we may need from you
        </h3>
        <p>

            We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right
            to
            access
            data (or exercise any of your other rights). This measure is security to ensure that data is not disclosed
            to
            anyone who
            does not have the right to receive it.
        </p>
        <p>

            We may also contact you to ask you for further information to improve our Services.

        <h3>
            How do we deal with the “right to be forgotten”?
        </h3>
        <p>
            You have the right to request the erasure of Data that we hold about you in certain circumstances, for
            example
            if it
            were not acquired for, or has ceased to be necessary for, a lawful purpose. This is known as the right to be
            forgotten.
            Where you request that we erase your Data, we will usually only do so where the Data has ceased to be
            publicly
            available
            or where we no longer use it.
        </p>
        <h3>
            LAWFUL BASIS
        </h3>
        <p>
            Legitimate Interest means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us
            to
            give you
            the best Service and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential
            impact on
            you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process Data or for our legitimate interests. We
            do
            not use
            Data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or
            are
            otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our
            legitimate
            interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.
        </p>
        <p>
            Comply with a legal obligation means processing Data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal
            obligation that
            we are subject to.

            YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS
        </h3>

        <p>
            You have the right to:
        </p>
        <p>

            Access to Data on our Platform. This enables you to receive a copy of Data we hold about you and to check
            that
            we are
            lawfully processing it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Request correction of the Data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate
            Data we
            hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new Data you provide to us.
        </p>
        <p>
            Request erasure of personal Data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Data where there is no good
            reason for
            us to continue to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove Data where you have
            successfully
            exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information
            unlawfully or
            where we are required to erase Data to comply with local law.
        </p>
        <p>

            Object to processing of Data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and
            there
            is
            something about your situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it
            impacts on
            your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object to where we are processing Data for
            direct
            marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process
            your
            information which override your rights and freedoms.
        </p>
        <p>
            Request restriction of processing of Data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of Data in
            the
            following
            scenarios:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>

                If you want us to establish the Data's accuracy.
            </li>
            <li>

                Where our use of the Data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it
            </li>
            <li>
                Where you need us to hold the Data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise
                or
                defend legal
                claims.

            </li>
            <li>
                You have objected to our use of Data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate
                grounds to use
                it.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

            Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process Data. However, this will not affect
            the
            lawfulness of any process carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may
            not
            be able
